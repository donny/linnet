# linnet

Linnet is a small Python script for [Scroll Bot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit) that displays current time and weather observation data using [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Scroll Bot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit) and [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org).

### Project

I read the first [announcement](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-zero-w-joins-family/) of [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero-w/) with much excitement. Imagine a Linux capable computer that has wireless built-in in a super tiny package! On the same day, I ordered a Pi Zero W kit from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/): the [Scroll Bot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-bot-pi-zero-w-project-kit). I spent an evening this week assembling the kit ([photo1](https://github.com/donny/linnet/blob/master/photo1.jpg), [photo2](https://github.com/donny/linnet/blob/master/photo2.jpg), [photo3](https://github.com/donny/linnet/blob/master/photo3.jpg)).

I downloaded [Raspbian Jessie Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [copied it](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-raspberry-pi-zero/making-an-sd-card-using-a-mac) to an SD card using [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). I installed the Scroll pHAT HD [SDK](https://github.com/pimoroni/scroll-phat-hd) and tried the example programs. So much fun!

After installing the Scroll pHAT HD [SDK](https://github.com/pimoroni/scroll-phat-hd) and [PyOWM](https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm); and getting the API key from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org).
